# CEN-Tamil_Abusive_Comment_Detection
This Repo cotains the code done by team CEN-Tamil for abusive comment detection in Tamil. The goal of this task is to identify
whether a given comment is a abusive comment among different categories. We used TF-IDF with char-wb analyzers
with Random Kitchen Sink (RKS) algorithm to create feature vectors and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with polynomial
kernel for classification. We used this method for both Tamil and Tamil-English datasets.
